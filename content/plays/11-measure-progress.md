title: "11 - Measure Progress"

---

There will be two sections here, technical and non-technical.

Make sure you are measuring progress both from a system perspective (metrics, logging, performance, etc.) and from a user perspective ([Usability.gov](https://usability.gov) and the [System Usability Survey](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)) for example.  Concepts like Net Promoter Score may also be appropriate, though they have their own flaws and caveats.
