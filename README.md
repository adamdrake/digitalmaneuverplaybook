# The Digital Maneuver Playbook

This is a playbook, or field manual, that helps technology organizations deliver value faster.

It is open source, CC0 licensed, and is available for use and modification by any interested parties.

It is comprised of two main components:

1. A higher-level overview and set of prerequisites (below) for building speed in innovation and delivery of software projects within organizations.  This is more strategic content.

2. A set of _plays_ that can be used as reference material or an FAQ of sorts.  Plays are designed to accelerate progress and adoption by providing structure and addressing common questions and concerns.

# Strategic change (prerequisites for plays, to be expanded)

* Software is never done
* [Software is Eating the World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)
* Software is not a cookie-cutter endeavor.  Most software projects, though they use common tools, are solving a previously unsolved business problem.
* Workforce and culture (do you have qualified people in the right places and do you listen to them?)
* AI is just Software + Data.  If you can't do both, you can't do AI.
