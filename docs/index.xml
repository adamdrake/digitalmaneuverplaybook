The goal of building good software and digital services should be to place the builders (those who build the systems) as close as possible to the users (the people actually using the system). In other words, cut out all the unhelpful middle-management.
Unfortunately, in large enterprises or government organizations it is the opposite of this approach that is the status quo.</description></item><item><title>02 - Hire and Empower Technologists</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/02-hire-and-empower-technologists.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/02-hire-and-empower-technologists.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>03 - Open by Default</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/03-open-by-default.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/03-open-by-default.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>04 - Certify the Process Not the Product</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/04-certify-the-process-not-the-product.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/04-certify-the-process-not-the-product.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>05 - APIs Everywhere</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/05-apis-everywhere.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/05-apis-everywhere.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>06 - Standardize Smartly</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/06-standardize-smartly.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/06-standardize-smartly.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>07 - Ruthlessly Automate</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/07-ruthlessly-automate.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/07-ruthlessly-automate.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>08 - Implement SRE Principles</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/08-implement-sre-principles.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/08-implement-sre-principles.html</guid><description>Thoughts from an SRE Runbooks go out of date faster than anything. Therefore it is absolutely crucial to have the whole book on a single page and alerts vector to the proper subsection. Also pepper each section with a good set of keywords. This will allow users and newbies to easily search for procedures or related alerts when links invariably break.
Group related alerts (&amp;ldquo;host xyz down&amp;rdquo;) in a single section with many section titles.</description></item><item><title>09 - Use Safer Programming Techniques</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/09-use-safer-programming-techniques.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/09-use-safer-programming-techniques.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>10 - Red Team Extensively</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/10-red-team-extensively.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/10-red-team-extensively.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>11 - Measure Progress</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/11-measure-progress.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/plays/11-measure-progress.html</guid><description>There will be two sections here, technical and non-technical.
Make sure you are measuring progress both from a system perspective (metrics, logging, performance, etc.) and from a user perspective (Usability.gov and the System Usability Survey) for example. Concepts like Net Promoter Score may also be appropriate, though they have their own flaws and caveats.</description></item><item><title>What is Software Development?</title><link>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/introduction/what-is-software-development.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://playbook.digitalmaneuver.com/introduction/what-is-software-development.html</guid><description>Introduction Software development is the process by which source code is produced in order to create a program that fulfills some goal. For most organizations, this often means automating something that humans would do manually, though this is not always the case.
There are some basic principles to consider about software development. Some of the principles address misconceptions, while others address the counterintuitive nature of software development generally. Remember that software development, unlike physical engineering efforts like building bridges or ships, is not constrained by physical reality.</description></item></channel></rss>
